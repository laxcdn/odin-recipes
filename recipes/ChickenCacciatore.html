            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <div class="section">
                <ul>
                <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
                <li>2 chicken breasts with skin and backbone, halved crosswise</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour, for dredging</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 large red bell pepper, chopped</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
                <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>1 ( 28-ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
                <li>3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons drained capers</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano leaves</li>
                <li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <div class="section">
                <ol>
                <li>Sprinkle the chicken pieces with 1 teaspoon of each salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour to coat lightly. </li>
                <li> In a large heavy saute pan, heat the oil over a medium-high flame. Add the chicken pieces to the pan and saute just until brown, about 5 minutes per side. If all the chicken does not fit in the pan, saute it in 2 batches. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside. Add the bell pepper, onion and garlic to the same pan and saute over medium heat until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes with their juice, broth, capers and oregano. Return the chicken pieces to the pan and turn them to coat in the sauce. Bring the sauce to a simmer. Continue simmering over medium-low heat until the chicken is just cooked through, about 30 minutes for the breast pieces, and 20 minutes for the thighs. </li>
                <li> Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a platter. If necessary, boil the sauce until it thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Spoon off any excess fat from atop the sauce. Spoon the sauce over the chicken, then sprinkle with the basil and serve. </li>
                </ol>
